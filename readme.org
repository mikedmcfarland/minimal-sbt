* Notes
- you can pull from other dependencies if you add more resolvers, only maven local is added. Typesafe's are common.

- =build.properties= isn't necessary, but I highly recommend you add it. It guarantees you use the same version of sbt every time. You will feel pain if you don't do this as SBTs api changes, and suddenly your build breaks for unknown reasons.
